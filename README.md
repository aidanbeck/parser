# syntaxlor
Convert hand-written text files into JSON with **tailored syntax**.

While JSON is human writable, the syntax won't meet every project's exact needs. If you want to write an interactive novel, it would be better to have a tailored syntax that can be converted into JSON.

## Old Cove Examples.
Syntaxlor solves a design program for my text based game [Old Cove](github.com/aidanbeck/old-cove).
The narrative's room & path structure can be defined with JSON or JavaScript, but it is incredibly verbose compared to traditional writing.

**An Example of an Old Cove room**
```
R['lighthouse'] = new Room(
    ['The lighthouse sits on the edge of a cliff, defiantly piercing the seascape behind it.',
        'You try the door, but it seems jammed.'
    ],
    [
        new Path('a road','Return to the road.'),
        new Path('lighthouse','Force it open.', ['You swing the axe at the door- it doesn\'t budge. You try again, harder this time, and it cracks.',
            'The axe head snaps from the end of the handle, embedding itself in the door as it lurches wide open.'
        ], '', axe, true, [
            new AlterDesc('lighthouse', ['The lighthouse sits on the edge of a cliff, defiantly piercing the seascape behind it.', 'The door is wide open, the head of an axe embedded into its front.', 'What used to be a handle is now splinters on the ground.']),
            new AlterPath('lighthouse',2,new Path('lighthouse 2', 'Enter.', ['You hesitate before walking inside.'])),
        ], 1)
    ],
    'lighthouse'
);
```
This room requires horizontal scrolling and memorized function inputs. It requires extensive symbols and formatting.

**The Same Room with Tailored Syntax**
```
#lighthouse %lighthouse
 The lighthouse sits on the edge of a cliff, defiantly piercing the seascape behind it. 
 You try the door, but it seems jammed.  ~breakIn   The door is wide open, the head of an axe embedded into its front.
 Empty                   ~breakIn   What used to be a handle is now splinters on the ground.

*Return to the road. > a road
 You walk back down the road.

*Force it open. -axe @breakIn <1
 You swing the axe at the doorâ€” it doesn't budge. You try again, harder this time, and it cracks.
 The axe head snaps from the end of the handle, embedding itself in the door as it lurches wide open.

*Enter. ~breakIn > lighthouse 2
You hesitate before walking inside.
```
This read naturally, and is faster to edit. It streamlines the syntax into single character symbols, and can be learned by non-developers.

**Syntax Symbols Tailored to Old Cove.**
```
#room key        -  the internal "id" of a room.
%given location  -  added to the player's location list.
~alteration      -  a signal that can be listened for to alter text here.
*button prompt   -  creates a new path with the given button prompt.
>target key      -  the "id" of the room the path should go to.

@change signal   -  a signal that can be emitted to alter text elsewhere.
<limit           -  the number of times an option can be chosen.
$required item   -  an item necessary to select an option.
-taken item      -  an item taken upon option selection.
+given item      -  an item given upon option selection.

`*ignored symbol -  a symbol you can use to ignore custom syntax.
empty            -  a keyword used to designate an empty string.
