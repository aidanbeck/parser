 The lighthouse sits on the edge of a cliff, defiantly piercing the seascape behind it. 
 You try the door, but it seems jammed.
 
*Return to the road. > a road
 You walk back down the road.

*Force it open. -axe @breakIn <1
 You swing the axe at the doorâ€” it doesn't budge. You try again, harder this time, and it cracks.
 The axe head snaps from the end of the handle, embedding itself in the door as it lurches wide open.

#living room %lighthouse
 It's a beautiful living room.
*Leave the room. > lighthouse
 You leave.
