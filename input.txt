 The lighthouse sits on the edge of a cliff, defiantly piercing the seascape behind it. 
 You try the door, but it seems jammed.  ~breakIn   The door is wide open, the head of an axe embedded into its front.
 Empty                   ~breakIn   What used to be a handle is now splinters on the ground.

*Return to the road. > a road
 You walk back down the road.

*Force it open. -axe @breakIn <1
 You swing the axe at the doorâ€” it doesn't budge. You try again, harder this time, and it cracks.
 The axe head snaps from the end of the handle, embedding itself in the door as it lurches wide open.

*Empty                   ~breakIn Enter. > lighthouse 2
                          You hesitate before walking inside.
